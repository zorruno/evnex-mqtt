// This builds on the unofficial API for EVNEX charge points by Anko Hanse from https://github.com/ankohanse/EVNEX
// It currently has simple MQTT Support to publish a status noting whether my car is charging, connected, or in error.
// Note that Anko's code won't be modified, but used purely as the API.

//
// Description:
//  Application to get data from your Evnex chargepoint via the Evnex cloud and publish to MQTT.
//  You must give option of --chargepoint-status and/or --chargepoint-activity to get output to MQTT.
//
// Usage:
//  evnex-mqtt [options]
//
// Options:
//  -i, --ini-file <ini-file>               The location of the ini file. [default: evnex.ini]
//  -d, --debug <Activity|All|None|Status>  Output 'Status', 'Activity' or 'All' info to console (Activity not currently Implemented)
//  -s, --chargepoint-status                Gets chargepoint status information and publishes to MQTT.
//  -a, --chargepoint-activity              Gets chargepoint activity information and publishes to MQTT. (not currently implemented)
//  --version                               Show version information
//  -?, -h, --help                          Show help and usage information
//
// Examples
//  evnex-mqtt -s (Publish status to MQTT, no console output)
//  evnex-mqtt -s -d Status (Publish status to MQTT and show the Status items on the console)
//
// Version
// 1.0 - zorruno - Aug 2022 - Initial use of Anko's API to pull data and push JSON documents to MQTT
// 1.1 - zorruno - Aug 2022 - Some work on JSON parsing to push items like 'Chargepoint Status' directly to MQTT topics
// 1.2 - zorruno - Aug 2022 - Deleted code that grabs everything except the main charger status points (a copy kept as program-full.cs.old)
// 1.3 - zorruno - Aug 2022 - Added command line options (not all yet doing something)
```

Features: 
- Has basic ini file for configuration of user/pass and MQTT parameters
- user and password is the same as your Evnex app
- command line parameters for simple or more complex output (so you can run both at various intervals)
- console output with debug selections
- Uses the unofficial API from Anko Hanse to pull data in JSON from the Evnex cloud service (read only)
- Connects to an MQTT Server and posts values to fixed subtopics
- an example output that was generated by the program-full (with debug on) is included here

Todo
- currently no MQTT auth or TLS
- one time run... plan is to have it run as a service
- containerise it with docker (dotnet container and S6 addons to daemonize it)
- ~~do some basic JSON parsing to get simple/most commonly used data into MQTT such as charger status~~
- more config options (MQTT subtopic names?, frequency of data grab?)
- possibly push some data into influxDB directly

Not currently proposed/Potential bugs
- only allows for one chargepoint currently (but built so it could be modified if you have multiple)
- doesn't allow for any return control (such as 'charge now', 'lock' etc).  Anko's API doesn't either.
- will likely break if Evnex change data structure or JSON names etc
- no idea how often you should pull data from their cloud... I suggest you don't abuse it
