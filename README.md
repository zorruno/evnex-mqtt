### Example use
```
// Initialize using same username and password as used 
// for the iOS/Android EVNEX app
var evnex = new EvnexV2( "evnexUsername", "evnexPassword" );

// Get user
dynamic user = await evnex.GetUser();

Console.WriteLine($"GetUser():");
Console.WriteLine(user);
				
string  userId = user.id;
string  orgId  = ((IEnumerable<dynamic>)user.organisations).Where(o => o.isDefault).Select(o => o.id).FirstOrDefault();

// Get indicated organization details
dynamic org  = await evnex.GetOrg(orgId);

Console.WriteLine($"GetOrg({orgId}):");
Console.WriteLine(org);

// Get all chargepoints of indicated organization
dynamic chargepoints = await evnex.GetOrgChargePoints(orgId);

Console.WriteLine($"GetOrgChargePoints({orgId}):");
Console.WriteLine(chargepoints);

string chargepointId = chargepoints.items[0].id;
string connectorId   = chargepoints.items[0].connectors[0].connectorId;
string locationId    = chargepoints.items[0].location.id;

// Get details of indicated chargepoint
dynamic chargepoint  = await evnex.GetChargePoint(chargepointId);

Console.WriteLine($"GetChargePoint({chargepointId}):");
Console.WriteLine(chargepoint);

// Get transactions of indicated chargepoint
dynamic transactions = await evnex.GetChargePointTransactions(chargepointId);

Console.WriteLine($"GetChargePointTransactions({chargepointId}):");
Console.WriteLine(transactions);

// Get organization insights for last x days
dynamic insights = await evnex.GetOrgInsights(orgId, 7);

Console.WriteLine($"GetOrgInsights({orgId},7):");
Console.WriteLine(transactions);

// Get location details
dynamic location = await evnex.GetLocation(locationId);

Console.WriteLine($"GetLocation({locationId}):");
Console.WriteLine(location);
